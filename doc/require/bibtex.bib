	abstract = {Cryptographic techniques have applications far beyond the obvious uses of encoding and decoding information. For Internet developers who need to know about capabilities, such as digital signatures, that depend on cryptographic techniques, there's no better overview than <b>Applied Cryptography</b>, the definitive book on the subject. Bruce Schneier covers general classes of cryptographic protocols and then specific techniques, detailing the inner workings of real-world cryptographic algorithms including the Data Encryption Standard and RSA public-key cryptosystems. The book includes source-code listings and extensive advice on the practical aspects of cryptography implementation, such as the importance of generating truly random numbers and of keeping keys secure. ". . .the best introduction to cryptography I've ever seen. . . . The book the National Security Agency wanted never to be published. . . ." -Wired Magazine<br> <br> ". . .monumental . . . fascinating . . . comprehensive . . . the definitive work on cryptography for computer programmers . . ." -Dr. Dobb's Journal<br> <br> ". . .easily ranks as one of the most authoritative in its field." -PC Magazine<br> <br> ". . .the bible of code hackers." -The Millennium Whole Earth Catalog<br> <br> This new edition of the cryptography classic provides you with a comprehensive survey of modern cryptography. The book details how programmers and electronic communications professionals can use cryptography-the technique of enciphering and deciphering messages-to maintain the privacy of computer data. It describes dozens of cryptography algorithms, gives practical advice on how to implement them into cryptographic software, and shows how they can be used to solve security problems. Covering the latest developments in practical cryptographic techniques, this new edition shows programmers who design computer applications, networks, and storage systems how they can build security into their software and systems.<br> <br> What's new in the Second Edition?<br> * New information on the Clipper Chip, including ways to defeat the key escrow mechanism<br> * New encryption algorithms, including algorithms from the former Soviet Union and South Africa, and the RC4 stream cipher<br> * The latest protocols for digital signatures, authentication, secure elections, digital cash, and more<br> * More detailed information on key management and cryptographic implementations},
