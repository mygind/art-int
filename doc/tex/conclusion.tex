\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{cha:conclusion}

as we weight a solution found quickly much higher than a short solution we prefer to use an advanced heuristic that does go a long way around once in a while.
The best planner would be to run both the A(+{*{B,B,a,a},c,4}) and the A(+{*{B,B,s,s},c,4}) and choose the shortest solution.
