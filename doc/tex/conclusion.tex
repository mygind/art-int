\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{cha:conclusion}

We have implemented the simple BFSolver, an \astar solver using a general heuristic (the SudGoalIndependence) and a number of heuristics optimized for the Sokoban problem.

We are not able to solve all Sokoban floorplans, and especially the original levelset seems to make our planner struggle. We have proposed a number of improvements in order to mitigate this.

The planner is able to get through the entire levelset 0 shown in appendix \ref{app:levelset0}. And this is only possible because of the heuristics optimized for the Sokoban puzzle.

As we weigh a solution found quickly much higher than a short solution we would prefer to use one of our advanced heuristics that quickly finds a longer solution.
The best planner we have created seems to be either the A(+{*{B,B,a,a},c,4}) or the A(+{*{B,B,s,s},c,4})\footnote{An explanation of the heuristics can be found in section \ref{sec:speedvssolsize}}.
