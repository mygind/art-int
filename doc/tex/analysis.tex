\chapter{Results and Analysis}
\label{cha:analysis}

\section{Introduction}
In this chapter we gather the results of the including the different
heuristics and algorithms in the solver. We go on to analyse these
results in order to determine the best combination of heuristic and
algorithm.

\section{Experimental Environment}
Here we define the set of levels on which we are going to compare the
heuristics and solvers. 

\subsection{Levelset}

\subsection{Variables}
Solution length, total no of states visited, total no of states seen, run
time, branching factor,
