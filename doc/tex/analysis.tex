\chapter{Results and Analysis}
\label{cha:analysis}

\section{Introduction}
In this chapter we gather the results of the including the different
heuristics and algorithms in the solver. We go on to analyse these
results in order to determine the best combination of heuristic and
algorithm.

\section{Experimental Environment}
Here we define the set of levels on which we are going to compare the
heuristics and solvers. 

\subsection{Levelset}
The 3D engine (see Chapter \ref{cha:design}) we found came with a
number of simple levelsets. We chose the first of these as our primary
target set. This set of levels is consists mostly of small levels. The
average area of the levels in this was found to be $52.4$, whereas the
original levelset (of which the first floor-plan is depicted in Figure
\ref{fig:soko-org-screen}) has an average area of
$280.1$.\footnote{These areas is computed by multiplying the number of
  lines in the level-file with the length of the longest line in the
  level. So it is not exact, but is a good indicator of difficulty.}

\subsection{Variables}
Solution length, total no of states visited, total no of states seen, run
time, branching factor,
