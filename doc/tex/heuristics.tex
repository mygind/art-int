\chapter{Defining Heuristics for Sokoban}
\label{cha:heuristics}

\section{Introduction}
In this chapter we examine which general heuristics are convenient to
the Sokoban domain and how they might be applied. Furthermore we
develop our own domain specific heuristic. These will all be
implemented in the planning application.

\section{General Heuristics}
We are required to implement at least one of the general heuristic
mentioned in \citet{Russell2003GeneralHeuristics}. This heuristic is
meant to be used as a base line of comparison when we implement a more
domain specific heuristic.

There are a number of different, general, ways of building a heuristic
for a given problem. 

\subsection{Relaxing the Sokoban Problem}
In order to relax a STRIPS style problem we can either remove or alter
the pre-conditions and/or effects. This approach has some inherent
challenges that we must overcome. It is also worth remembering that
the developed heuristic \emph{must} be simpler than solving the
original problem in order for this exercise to make any sense.
