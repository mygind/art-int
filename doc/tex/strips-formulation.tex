\chapter{Formally Defining Sokoban}

\section{Introduction}
In order to effectively solve the Sokoban problem we need to define
the game in a formal manner. To this end we chose to define the
Sokoban game in a variant of STRIPS.



\section{Analysis}
Numerical STRIPS developed by \citet{Hoffmann03themetric-ff} in
\citeyear{Hoffmann03themetric-ff} adds arithmetic and boolean
operators along with numeric variables to the STRIPS language. Using
this extension gives us a more powerful language, which in turn lets
us create a more simpel STRIPS model of Sokoban.

We wish to keep our STRIPS description as simple as possible. If we
look at the rules of the game we see that the only real action is to
move the player, everything else happens is a result of this.
